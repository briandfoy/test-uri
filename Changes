	* added new functions uri_path_ok and uri_fragment_ok
	* re-implemented some methods to use some common code, so there
	is an additional redirection which might screw up external code
	that looks at the file and line for error messages
	* cleaned up the distribution for modern best practices
	* no need to upgrade unless you want the new functions
